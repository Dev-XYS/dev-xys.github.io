    <h2>My Status</h2>
    <p>I am a junior undergraduate student at Peking University, major in Computer Science. I'm currently doing research in Programming Language Lab at Peking University, advised by <a href="http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~hu/">Prof. Zhenjiang Hu</a>. My current research project is about adapting APIs for functional languages.</p>
    <p>I took several interesting courses this semester. They are Computer Networks (Honor Track), Design Principles of Programming Languages, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Introduction to Psychology. (To clarify I have to say that I'm not interested in machine learning. I just take the course to fulfill the requirement for graduation.)</p>
    <p>I am a member of the student string orchestra at Peking University. We rehearse every Friday and Sunday, and we are going to hold a concert in May.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>My short-term goal is to conduct a complete research by myself. My current project is about adapting APIs for functional languages. I also plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree after graduation from Peking University. My long-term goal may be to become an outstanding researcher on programming languages and logic. But that may change, and I'm still exploring.</p>

    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
    <p>I have a broad interest in programming languages and related subjects. My research career has just started and I believe there are unlimited possibilities. I want to explore more and for now I won't say which specific branch I'm interested in.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p><b>Peking University, Beijing, China</b></p>
    <ul><i>B.S. Computer Science.</i> Member of Turing Class. (Expected graduation: June, 2022)</ul>
    <p><b>Dalian No. 24 High School, Dalian, China</b></p>

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Adapting APIs for Haskell Library <span class="normal">(<i>current</i>)</span></h4>
        <p>I am working at automatically generating compatibility layers for different versions of Haskell libraries. Our goal is to enable clients that use the old version library to adapt to new versions without modification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Domain-specific Language Tool Development <span class="normal">(<i>ongoing, long-term)</i></span></h4>
        <p>We are developing a DSL tool which can automatically generate interpreters, compilers, and analyzers for DSLs designed by language experts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal & Course Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>A Common-Lisp-to-.NET Compiler</h4>
        <p>Course project for Compiler Lab (Honor Track), a three-pass compiler that compiles Common Lisp code to CIL (Common Intermediate Language). It has dead code elimination, tail recursive elimination and peephole optimization.</p>
        <p>Open-source at <a href="https://github.com/Dev-XYS/CommonLisp-to-Dotnet-Compiler"><span class="url">https://github.com/Dev-XYS/CommonLisp-to-Dotnet-Compiler</span></a>. (Readme is written in Chinese.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Algorithm Library</h4>
        <p>A collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in C++. It has gained over a thousand stars on GitHub. Actually, it took me a little effort to achieve that many stars. I advertised the repo on Zhihu and thus attract many people to it.</p>
        <p>Available at <a href="https://github.com/Dev-XYS/Algorithms"><span class="url">https://github.com/Dev-XYS/Algorithms</span></a>. (Readme and commit messages are written in Chinese.)</p>

    <h2>Teaching Experiences</h2>
    <ul>Teaching Assistant, Introduction to Computer Systems (seminar) (Fall, 2020)</ul>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>I've been using Google Calendar for the last semester and found it very useful. Here is my schedule.</p>
