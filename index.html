    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>I am a senior undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in Computer Science. I am doing research in Programming Language Lab at Peking University, advised by <a href="http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~hu/">Prof. Zhenjiang Hu</a>. My current focus is on the work of undergraduate thesis.</p>
    <p>I am taking three courses this semester, which are <i>Accounting</i>, <i>Chip Design using High-level Programming Language</i>, and <i>Shadowboxing</i>.</p>
    <p>I am a member of the student string orchestra at Peking University. We are now rehearsing Haydn Symphony No.39, Mozart Symphony No.40, and Mendelssohn String Octet.</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>My short-term goal is to conduct a complete research by myself. My current project involves exploring the expressivity of syntactic sugars. I also plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree after graduation from Peking University. My long-term goal may be to become an outstanding researcher on programming languages and logic. But that may change, and I’m still exploring.</p>

    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
    <p>I have a broad interest in programming languages and related subjects. My research career has just started and I believe there are unlimited possibilities. I am especially enthusiastic about research that has a real-world impact.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p><b>Peking University, Beijing, China</b></p>
    <ul><i>B.S. Computer Science.</i> Member of Turing Class. (Expected graduation: June, 2022)</ul>
    <p><b>Dalian No. 24 High School, Dalian, China</b></p>

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Automatic Generation of Integrated Development Environment for Domain-Specific Languages <span class="normal">(<i>current</i>)</span></h4>
        <p>I am working at automatically generating integrated development environment for domain-specific languages built with sugars. The idea is to implement a middle-layer that communicates between the surface syntax and existing core <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language servers</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Domain-specific Language Tool Development <span class="normal">(<i>ongoing, long-term)</i></span></h4>
        <p>We are developing a DSL tool which can automatically generate interpreters, compilers, and analyzers for DSLs designed by language experts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal & Course Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>A Common-Lisp-to-.NET Compiler</h4>
        <p>Course project for Compiler Lab (Honor Track), a three-pass compiler that compiles Common Lisp code to CIL (Common Intermediate Language). It has dead code elimination, tail recursive elimination and peephole optimization.</p>
        <p>Open-source at <a href="https://github.com/Dev-XYS/CommonLisp-to-Dotnet-Compiler"><span class="url">https://github.com/Dev-XYS/CommonLisp-to-Dotnet-Compiler</span></a>. (Readme is written in Chinese.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Algorithm Library</h4>
        <p>A collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in C++. It has gained over a thousand stars on GitHub. Actually, it took me a little effort to achieve that many stars. I advertised the repo on Zhihu and thus attract many people to it.</p>
        <p>Available at <a href="https://github.com/Dev-XYS/Algorithms"><span class="url">https://github.com/Dev-XYS/Algorithms</span></a>. (Readme and commit messages are written in Chinese.)</p>
      </li>
